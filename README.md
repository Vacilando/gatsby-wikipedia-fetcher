# Gatsby Wikipedia Fetcher

<sup></sup>

## TL;DR

GatsbyJS plugin with the ability to retrieve various bits of Wikipedia data and reuse them in your site.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Wikipedia is the most successful collaborative knowledge base ever achieved on this planet. Just as we all contribute to it with our bits of information, it is only natural that we reach for it when we need to incorporate some of its data in other web projects. Luckily, this is made simple thanks to the excellent [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).

Rather than trying to write the same again and again, we reuse what has already been written and reviewed at Wikipedia.

This project goes even a step further. Not only does it allow to embed bits and pieces of Wikipedia in your own Gatsby project, it also empowers you to _keep the information alive_. That is to say that any future updates provided by fellow humans around the world will automatically find their way to your site as well!

Copied data starts to age immediately whereas data included provided by an API is always accurate.

gatsby-wikipedia-fetcher is a plugin that makes it easy to pick larger or smaller pieces of various Wikipedia content (page extract, illustration image, etc.) and include them in your Gatsby site.
This plugin stands on the shoulders of the wonderful [wtf_wikipedia](https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia) by [Spencer Kelly](https://github.com/spencermountain) et al.

## How to install

1. Install the package with **npm** or **yarn**

   `npm install gatsby-wikipedia-fetcher`

        // E-mail address to be included in the Wikipedia API calls to limit the risk of being blacklisted.
        email: `user@example.com`,
      },
    },
